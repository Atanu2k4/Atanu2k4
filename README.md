# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I'm a second-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering 🎓. My journey in technology has been an exciting exploration of various fields, and I'm passionate about continuously learning and expanding my skill set 📚. I'm currently diving into the world of web development and graphic design 🎨. I love the creativity and technical challenges that come with building and designing web applications 🌐. Exploring the latest technologies and frameworks, I'm eager to develop innovative solutions that blend functionality and aesthetics. 💻I have a basic knowledge of C and C++ and am familiar with the syntax of Python . These languages have given me a solid foundation to explore more complex concepts in computer science and software development. In my free time, I enjoy solving different types of puzzles and the Rubik's Cube 🧩. These hobbies not only keep me engaged but also sharpen my problem-solving skills, which are invaluable in programming and technical challenges. As I continue my studies and projects, I'm excited to deepen my knowledge and collaborate with others in the community 🤝. Let's create something amazing together! Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or through other platforms. 🚀
